# Udacity-Assignment-1-3
This is my assignment Code Your Own Quiz Project for the Udacity Intro to Program Nanodegree Project. 
As a former Italian teacher, I enjoyed adding my knowledge to build my Python quiz.  I created the_Italian_ Learning fill in the blanks quiz._   At the end of this quiz, players will be ready to introduce themselves in Italian and have a basic conversation.

If you fancy, please try it and leave a comment below to tell me about your experience.
